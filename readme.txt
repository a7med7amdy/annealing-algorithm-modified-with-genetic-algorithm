this code is in python 3.3, you need to install numpy and matplotlib specially.

at the last of the code, there's mainrun sentence it will run the code

in order to change INF,alpha , threshold at the beggining "please read the comments carefully".

to  make different size blocks or same size write false/true in annealing section code calling initialization  "please read the comments carefully"

to give weights between each two connected blocks (indicating how many wires between) put the number needed in mainrun section code, calling create

to choose number of population, in annealing code section, calling process. put the number needed. please enter even number as in the logic each 2 random blocks mutates.

This code has to be refactored to be better but it's released due to the deadline and will be refactored later

last thing, please read all comments carefully to avoid making error.

thanks
